# ClickPerSecondCheat
Before we begin - chromedriver - the executable. This allows you to automate the browser.Get it 
off of https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads 
Then copy the path , make sure it ends in chromedriver.exe and put it into the program.
This is just a simple script that'll automate the clicking on https://cpstest.org/
I could've done this with a macro or pynput, but selenium seems cool as it's internal clicks etc.
have fun :)
Make sure you follow the tos - this is a demonstration...
