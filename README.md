# ClickPerSecondCheat
Before we begin - chromedriver - the executable. This allows you to automate the browser. I've put it in there just incase you don't know what your doing, but by all means get it off of https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads if it makes you feel more comfortable. Anyways...

This is just a simple script that'll automate the clicking on https://cpstest.org/
I could've done this with a macro or pynput, but selenium seems cool as it's internal clicks etc.
have fun :)
Make sure you follow the tos - this is a demonstration...
